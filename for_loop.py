# let's Practice: using For loop
# Q1: Print the elements of the following list using a loop:
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# nums = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
# for el in nums:
#     print(el)


# Q2: Search for a number x in this tuple using loop:
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# nums = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 49]
# x = 49

# for el in nums:
#   if(el == x):
#     print("number found at idx", idx)
#     break
#     idx += 1



# Range():
# seq = range(15)
# for i in seq:
#     print(i)

# for i in range(10): #range(stop)
#     print(i)

# for i in range(2, 10): #range(start, stop)
#     print(i)

# for i in range(2, 101, 2): 
#     print(i)

#let's practice: Usin for & range:
# Q1: Print numbers from 1 to 100.

# for i in range(1, 101):
#     print(i)


# Q2: Print numbers from 100 to 1.

# for i in range(100, 0, -1):
#    print(i)


# Q3: Print the multiplication table of a number n.
# n = int(input("enter number:" ))

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print(n * i)

#Pass statement:
# for i in range(5):
#     #empty

# print("some useful work")   

# for i in range(5):
#     pass
# if i > 5:
#     pass
# print("some useful work")  

# let's Practice: 
# Question: what a program to find the sum of first n numbers.(using for)

#  n = 5

# sum = 0
# for i in range(1, n+1):
#     sum +=i

#     print("total sum =", sum)


# Question: what a program to find the factorial of first n numbers.(using for)

# n = 5
# fact = 1
# for i in range(1, n+1):
#     fact *= i
#     print("factorial =", fact)


# Print each fruit in a fruit list:

# fruit = ["apple", "mango", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi"]
# for x in fruit:
#     print(x)

# Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "Mango":
    print(x)
